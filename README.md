# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
## My name is Victor Gomes Mendes and my nickname is "victormendexx"!

- 🔭 I am currently working at Eksy wich is is a startup that owns a tool app for personal trainers. I usually deal with different demands, both in the old project built with PHP and YII and the new one in JavaScript. These demands include technology migration, restructuring the non-relational database, adding features, and fixing bugs. The platform has several fronts (helpdesk, hotsite, coach, and student), and I work on all of them, mainly on the back-end.
- 🌱 I'm also currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at the National Institute of Santa Catarina, but I have already finished the 'Python Entra21' course sponsored by the state government of Santa Catarina and anchor companies.
- 🏋🏽 Fun fact: My biggest hobby is working out, I can really say that I'm addicted to it. I believe that this hobby has taught me many life values such as leadership, commitment, and effort.
