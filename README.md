# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
## My name is Victor Gomes Mendes, but you can call me "victormendexx"! 🚀

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Fullstack Developer at **Premiersoft**, where I build scalable web applications using **TypeScript**, **React**, and **NestJS**. I joined through their internal Academy program, which included technical training and residency in real-world projects.  
- 🛠 Previously, I worked at **Eksy**, a startup that provides tools for personal trainers. There, I dealt with diverse demands across multiple platform areas (helpdesk, hotsite, coach, and student), mainly focusing on backend tasks. My responsibilities involved **technology migration** from PHP/YII to JavaScript, **NoSQL database restructuring**, feature implementation, and bug fixing.  
- 🐍 I also had the opportunity to work with **Python and Django** at the **INSS**, automating internal workflows and integrating RESTful APIs.  
- 🎓 I’m currently pursuing a degree in **Systems Analysis and Development** at **IFSC**, one of the top-rated tech institutes in Brazil. In parallel, I completed a 360-hour course in Python through the **Entra21** program, where I gained hands-on experience in collaborative, agile-based software development environments.  
- 📚 I enjoy working with both front-end and back-end technologies and I’m always looking to sharpen my skills and take on new challenges.  
- 🧠 I’m passionate about personal and professional growth, and I believe technology should be used to create smart and efficient solutions.  
- 🏋🏽 Fun fact: I’m a fitness enthusiast! Weight training is a big part of my life and has taught me essential values such as discipline, consistency, and resilience — traits I carry into my career as a developer.
